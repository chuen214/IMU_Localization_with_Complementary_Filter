# IMU_Localization_with_Complementary_Filter
This project demonstrates how to use an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) with a complementary filter to perform localization and estimate the position and orientation of an object. The complementary filter is used to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data to achieve stable and accurate position tracking.
